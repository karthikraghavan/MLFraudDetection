# Bank Account Fraud Detection

Every year, financial institutions lose billions of dollars to fraud. Identity theft, fake documents, and online banking fraud are some methods fraudsters use to open accounts and steal information. One practical approach to enhancing the fraud detection technique is to leverage Machine learning/Artificial Intelligence. The project aims to conduct a statistical analysis of the Bank Account Fraud (BAF) dataset ((Bank Account Fraud Dataset Suite (NeurIPS 2022), n.d.)) and use various machine learning algorithms to predict whether a bank account is fraudulent or legitimate accurately. The key steps include analyzing and manipulating the Bank Account Fraud dataset and creating a solid prediction algorithm to classify fraudulent accounts based on different features in the bank account application.

## About the Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is the Bank Application Fraud Dataset published at Neuro IPS 2022.
